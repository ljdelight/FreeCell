# FreeCell
This is another very old program of mine. Parts of the code are terrible! I'm keeping this so I don't forget where I started.

Anyway, this program implements the card game FreeCell. I did some neat stuff to make the output look nice, and move some cards automatically to the foundation pile (just like most GUI versions do). I reached just over 1000 LOC.


## How to compile & run
Simply call ```$ make```. Then execute ```$ ./FreeCell```.
